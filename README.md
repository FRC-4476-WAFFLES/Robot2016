This is a robot(code) for W.A.F.F.L.E.S(4476)

Things to consider when running this code:

1. The intake must start "In" when the robot is first enabled, we are able to change this, but will need notice prior to the match.
2. The ADefenses must start "In" when the robot is first enabled.
3. If anything is changed on the robot that might affect code, tell a programmer.
4. If you don't like button mappings, ask a programmer to change them.

Button mappings:

|      Function       |       Button        |
